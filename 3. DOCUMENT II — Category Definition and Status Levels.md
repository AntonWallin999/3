# **DOCUMENT II**

<br />

## **RP9 — Category definition and Status levels**


### **Status**

**Classification document.**
This document is **not part of the foundation** and adds **no causality**.

---

### **Ground rule**

> The word _axiom_ may only refer to **Axiom R0**.
> All other usage is formally invalid within RP9.

---

### **Level 0 — Axiom (Ground)**

- Exactly one element: **Axiom R0**

- Non-derivable

- Cause, not result

If this level is denied, all other levels semantically collapse.

---

### **Level 1 — Primary expressions of the axiom**

**Definition**

> A primary expression is a way of describing Axiom R0
> as **relational potential**, without introducing function, process or new causality.

Properties:

- not separate entities

- not active

- not necessary for the axiom

Examples (presentation, not basis):

- duality / bisection

- √3 as relational quotient

- 4-division, 7 positions

- 28 relational states

If all level-1 elements are removed:

- RP9 remains completely intact

---

### **Level 2 — Secondary compositions and applications**

**Definition**

> Any structure that arises through selection, combination or representation.

Properties:

- fully dependent

- fully interchangeable

- no basic status

Examples:

- matrices

- models

- visualizations

- practical applications

If all level-2 elements are removed:

- levels 0 and 1 remain unchanged

---

### **Coexistence rule**

The relationship is one-sided:

```
RP9 (Basic)
↓
Categorisation
↓
Further work
```

No feedback is allowed.
