# Pedagogical Introduction – The Vesica Meta-Structure

This Meta document is not constructed linearly but fractally.  
All structure, all constants, and all mathematical relations arise simultaneously  
from the Vesica Piscis, and therefore cannot be described as a sequence of events.

To resolve this, we use _modules_.

Each module represents an aspect of the same original geometric form.  
The modules are therefore parallel, not hierarchical, and should be read as a library:

- no module comes before another,
    
- no module is a prerequisite for another,
    
- all modules are projections of the same original pulse.
    

Your material will be rewritten and sorted into the appropriate module.  
The final result will be a complete Meta-library of the Vesica’s mathematical nature.
