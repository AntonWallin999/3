# Module 2 – Algebraic consequences (√2, √3, π, φ, √π)

This module collects everything that shows how Vesican generates mathematical constants:

- √2 from linear diagonal
- √3 from triadic relation
- π from the rotation structure
- φ from spiral expansion
- √π from surface–volume transformation

Here all derivations, formulas and rational connections end up.

## Module 2 — Algebraic consequences
Focus:
- $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $\pi$, $\varphi$, $\sqrt{\pi}$
- algebraically transformed relations
- derivatives arising from Vesican's stable field
Role:
The first layer of mathematics arising from Vesican's invariant proportions.
