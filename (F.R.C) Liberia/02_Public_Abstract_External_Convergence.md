## External Convergence and Invariance

- RP9's structure coincides causally with how stability is verified in several independent domains, including software verification, network science, and complex systems. In these fields, truth is defined not by numerical results, but by invariant relations. 

- RP9 shows why this is necessary: ​​invariance is not a method, but a consequence of relational closure. The 28 functional states derived in RP9 constitute the smallest complete invariance space that all stable systems implicitly realize.
