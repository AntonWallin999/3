## **Definition F0 — Primary relational function (standing fractal)**

### Definition

> **F0 (Primary relational function)**
>
> Given **Axiom R0**, **F0** is defined as the only allowed operation on the primary relation, such that:
>
> 1. **F0 acts exclusively on the relation in R0**, not on external objects, representations, or symbols.
>
> 2. **F0 introduces no new causal principle**, but reuses exactly the same relational conditions that define R0.
>
> 3. **F0 is closed under its own application**:
> the result of F0 is of the same relational type as its input.
>
> 4. **F0 preserves relational identity** under iteration up to scale, orientation, and position.
>
> 5. **F0 is minimal**:
> no simpler non-trivial operation exists that satisfies (1)–(4).
>

### Functional Consequentiality

Repeated application of **F0** necessarily generates:

- recursive relational structures,

- scale-independent forms,

- fractal continuity,

without introducing new axioms, definitions, or external assumptions.

---

### Negative Verification

If **F0** does not exist:

- R0 cannot act,

- no iteration can occur,

- no structure can arise,

- and the system remains static and contentless.

If **F0** exists but does not satisfy (1)–(5):

- relational invariance is broken,

- new causality is introduced,

- or the iteration collapses.

In all cases, the internal closedness of the system ceases.

---

### Status

**F0 is not an axiom.**
**F0 is not a theorem.**

**F0 is the necessary primary function that makes R0 work.**

---

This is the **standing fractal** in the exact sense:
a function that can be applied to its own result without losing identity.

When this definition is inserted:

- **Theorem T0** becomes a direct consequence,

- **Corollary C0** becomes inevitable,

- and **Final Declaration D0** becomes a pure closure.
