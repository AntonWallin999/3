## **DOCUMENT III**

<br />

# **Reviewer Notes — Instructions and Scope Lock**

### **Purpose of review**

The reviewer is asked to verify **only** the following:

- that RP9 contains exactly one axiom

- that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced

- that other material lacks causal and necessary status

---

### **What not to evaluate**

The reviewer shall **not**:

- assess truthfulness

- assess empirical validity

- assess usability

- compare with external theories or frameworks

RP9 is treated as a **closed textual artifact**.

---

### Text type (formal classification)

This text is:

- declarative

- non-predicative

- non-constructive

It introduces no objects, no existence assumptions and no procedures.

---

### **Terminological lock**

- _Axiom_ = only Axiom R0

- _Expression_ = description without causality

- _Application_ = secondary structure

Any deviations from this should be considered **formal errors**.

---

### **Review conclusion (expected form)**

A correct review should be able to determine:

- whether the system is **axiomatically minimal**

- whether the causality is **closed**

- whether the system **collapses completely** upon denial of the axiom

No other conclusion is requested.

---

## **Final Declaration**

This submission package presents:

- a single necessary foundation

- a strict classification without causal force

- full separation between axioms, expressions and applications

> **The foundation stands alone.
> Everything else is order.**
