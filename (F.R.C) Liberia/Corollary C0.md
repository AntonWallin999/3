## **Corollary C0 — Secondary Causality for All Non-R0 Structures**

### Assumptions

- **Axiom R0** is given.

- **Definition F0** is given.

- **Theorem T0** is given.

No further assumptions are introduced.

---

### Corollary

> **Corollary C0 (Secondary Causality for All Non-R0 Structures)**
>
> Every structure, form, operation, or statement that **cannot** be generated by iterative application of **F0** to **R0** is necessarily **secondary**.
>
> Secondary here means: dependent on representation, convention, external parameterization, or added operators, and thus lacking absolute information status in the system's sense.

---

### Direct derivation (ultralogical)

1. According to **Theorem T0**, all absolute information is exactly the amount that can be generated from **R0** by **F0**.

2. Therefore, there are only two classes of structures:

- **Class A:** generable by (F0^n(R0)) for some (n).

- **Class B:** non-generable by (F0^n(R0)) for some (n).

3. A structure in **Class B** cannot be absolute, since it does not arise from the only allowed primary function chain.

4. For a structure in **Class B** to still exist, at least one of the following must be true:

- a new operator has been introduced,

- an external parameter has been injected,

- a representation has been replaced by a “thing”,

- a convention has been chosen.

5. All of these imply dependence on something not given by **R0** and **F0**.

6. Thus all **Class B** is secondary.

The corollary follows necessarily.

---

### Negative verification

If **Corollary C0** does not hold, there is a structure that:

- is not generated by **F0** from **R0**, but

- is still absolute.

This requires that absolute information exists outside the single absolute generative chain, which contradicts **Theorem T0**.

Thus **C0** must hold.

---

### Status

**C0 does not introduce any new content.**
It is a pure classification that follows directly from T0:

- **Absolute** = generated by (F0^n(R0))

- **Secondary** = everything else

---

### Causal chain (locking)

**R0 → F0 → T0 → C0 → D0**

C0 is now formally a direct consequence, without semantic space.
