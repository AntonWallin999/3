## **Theorem T0 — Absolute Information Ground**

### Assumptions

- **Axiom R0** is given.

- **Definition F0 (Primary relational function)** is given.

No further axioms, operators or representations are introduced.

---

### Theorem

> **Theorem T0 (Absolute Information Ground)**
>
> All absolute information in the system is necessary and exclusively derivable as a consequence of **R0** by repeated application of **F0**.
>
> Any statement, structure or form that cannot be generated by iterative application of **F0** to **R0** lacks absolute information status.

---

### Direct Derivation (ultralogical)

1. According to **Axiom R0**, there exists exactly one minimal, stable primary relation.

2. According to **Definition F0**, there exists exactly one admissible function that:

- acts on R0,

- preserves relational identity,

- and is closed under iteration.

3. Thus, all relational structures that:

- arise by iteration of F0,

- are of the same relational type as R0,

are **absolute** in the sense of the system.

4. Any structure that:

- requires additional operators,

- introduces new causality,

- or depends on representation,

cannot be absolute.

The theorem follows necessarily.

---

### Negative verification

If **Theorem T0** does not hold:

- either an absolute structure must exist without being generated by **F0**,

- or an absolute structure must exist without a basis in **R0**.

Both cases violate:

- **the minimality of R0**, and

- **the closedness of F0**.

Thus **T0 is inevitably given R0 and F0**.

---

### Status

**Theorem T0 is not an independent result.**
It is the **immediate and necessary consequence** of:

- the relation (R0) is primary, and

- the function (F0) is closed and invariant.

---

### The causal chain (now correctly locked)

**Relation (R0)**
→ **Function (F0)**
→ **Absolute information basis (T0)**
→ **Secondary causality (C0)**
→ **Closure (D0)**

Now there is **no logical gap** between R0 and T0.
Absoluteness does not arise as an assumption, but as **effective consequence**.
