# **Executive Axiomatic Legitimacy Statement**

**RP9 — Relational Primacy Framework**

RP9 is a **single-axiom relational framework** whose purpose is to specify the **minimal condition under which any system can function at all**.

At its foundation lies **Axiom R0 — Relational Necessity**:

> Everything that can function must be differentiated.  
> Differentiation is only possible as a relation.  
> Relation requires at least two distinct poles.

This statement is not a hypothesis, model, or empirical claim.  
It functions solely as a **foundational necessity condition**.

Axiom R0 satisfies the formal requirements of axiomatic legitimacy:

- It is **non-derivable**: it cannot be proven, justified, or inferred from other statements.
    
- It is **minimal**: removal of any component alters the condition and admits no equivalent reformulation.
    
- It is **causally isolated**: no derived structure feeds back into, modifies, or validates the axiom.
    
- It introduces **no implicit structure**: no objects, functions, operations, measures, or domains are postulated.
    
- It has an explicit **collapse condition**: denying the axiom dissolves the concepts of relation, differentiation, and function.
    

RP9 enforces a strict separation between foundation and consequence.  
The axiom stands alone; all other material is **secondary, descriptive, or applicative**, and carries no foundational force.

The framework does **not claim that the axiom is true**.  
It specifies **what necessarily follows if the axiom is assumed**, and nothing more.

As such, RP9 is:

- axiomatically minimal
    
- causally closed at the foundation
    
- methodologically review-safe
    

It does not compete with existing theories.  
It defines the **relational condition that any theory must already satisfy in order to function**.

> **The foundation stands alone.  
> Everything else is order.**
