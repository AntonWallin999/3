# Module 7 – Logarithmic structure (ln(2), the half-half constant)

Here are placed:

- the logarithm as Vesican's internal language for balance
- the constant ln(2) as an expression for half-half symmetry
- connections with φ and √π
- stabilization principles

This module defines Vesican's internal scale functions.
