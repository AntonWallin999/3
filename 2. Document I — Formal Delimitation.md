# **DOCUMENT I — Formal Delimitation**

<br />

## **Status**

**Non-ground protective document.**  
This document is **not part of the foundation** and introduces **no causal structure**.

---

## **Purpose**

The sole purpose of this document is to **formally delimit** the scope and role of  
**Axiom R0 — Relational Necessity** within RP9.

It exists to prevent:

- misclassification,
    
- accidental derivation,
    
- and unauthorized extension of the foundation.
    

This document introduces **no claims of its own**.

---

## **Foundational Statement**

> **Axiom R0 is the only non-derivative statement in RP9.**

Everything else in the framework is:

- dependent,
    
- descriptive,
    
- classificatory,
    
- or interpretative.
    

This document does **not** add to the axiom.  
It only specifies **what follows if the axiom is assumed**.

---

## **What the Axiom Does _Not_ Introduce**

Axiom R0 introduces:

- no objects
    
- no functions
    
- no operations
    
- no measures
    
- no representations
    
- no domains of application
    

It establishes **only a relational necessity condition**.

---

## **Non-derivation Rule**

No statement within RP9 may be treated as:

- co-axiomatic,
    
- implicitly foundational,
    
- or independently necessary
    

other than **Axiom R0 itself**.

All other documents are **strictly secondary**.

---

## **Metastatus Clarification**

This document:

- does **not** assert that Axiom R0 is true
    
- does **not** defend the axiom
    
- does **not** justify the axiom
    

It only specifies the **logical consequences of assuming it**.

---

## **Equivalent Linguistic Restatements (Non-generative)**

The following are **restatements**, not consequences:

- An undifferentiated state cannot function.
    
- Function presupposes relation.
    
- Relation presupposes at least two distinct poles.
    

These formulations:

- add no structure,
    
- introduce no causality,
    
- and are not independently operative.
    

---

## **Collapse Condition**

If **Axiom R0** is denied:

- the concepts of relation, differentiation, and function lose definition
    
- all subsequent documents lose semantic grounding
    
- the framework collapses entirely
    

No part of RP9 survives independently of the axiom.

---

## **Final Lock**

RP9 therefore contains:

- **one** axiom
    
- **zero** foundational functions
    
- **zero** free parameters
    
- **zero** derivation chains at ground level
    

All remaining text is:

- organizational,
    
- classificatory,
    
- or explanatory only.
    

> **The foundation stands alone.  
> Everything else is order.**
