# Module 6 – Sphere–Cube duality as Vesica projection

This module brings together everything that describes:

- the transition between circular (spherical) and edged (cubic) geometry
- rational versus continuous space
- Vesican as the interface between these two

This includes both geometric, physical and topological aspects.
