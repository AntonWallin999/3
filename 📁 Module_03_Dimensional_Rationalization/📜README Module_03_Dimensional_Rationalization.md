# Module 3 – Dimensional Rationalization (Hausdorff, Transitions)

Here is placed everything related to the role of Vesican in dimensional theory:

- Hausdorff dimensions
- the transition 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D
- fractal dimensional jumps
- topological transitions

The module defines how Vesican rationalizes dimensions through its internal proportions.
