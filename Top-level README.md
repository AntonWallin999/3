# RP9 — Relational Primacy Framework

<br />

## Top-level README

This repository contains the **complete, final public release** of  
**RP9 — Relational Primacy Framework (v1.0)**.

RP9 is a **single-axiom relational framework** that specifies a **closed causal origin**
while allowing **open systemic consequences**.

No objects, forces, dimensions, measures, or empirical assumptions are postulated.

---

## Core properties

- **Axiom count:** exactly one (Axiom R0)
- **Causal status:** closed at the foundation
- **Systemic consequences:** open and non-restrictive
- **Derivations:** none at ground level
- **Review status:** methodologically locked

RP9 does not compete with existing theories or frameworks.  
It specifies the **condition under which any framework can function at all**.

---

## Repository structure (authoritative record)

This repository constitutes the **frozen reference archive** of RP9.

It contains:

- the single axiom (LEVEL 0)
- formal boundary and classification documents (non-ground)
- reviewer instructions and scope lock
- appendices (interpretative, non-causal)
- a complete AI-based axiomatic stress test
- license and contribution policy

Nothing outside this repository is required to review RP9 formally.

---

## Interactive inspection (read-only)

An interactive inspection view of the material and the stress test is provided via
**Google NotebookLM**.

**NotebookLM is provided as a read-only inspection view.  
 This GitHub repository constitutes the authoritative record.**

Reviewers may recreate the stress test independently by using the archived material
and running their own NotebookLM session:

## How to read RP9

1. Start with **Axiom R0** (LEVEL 0)
2. Read **Document I — Formal Delimitation**
3. Read **Document II — Category Definition and Status Levels**
4. Read **Document III — Reviewer Notes / Scope Lock**
5. Consult appendices **only after** the above

Appendices add **no ground** and **no causal force**.

## Status

- Framework version: **v1.0**
- Relational circuit: **closed**
- System: **open**
- Review status: **peer-review ready**
- Change policy: **locked at foundation**
