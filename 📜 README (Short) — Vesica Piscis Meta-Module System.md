This is the overview of the entire Vesica–Module–Image system.

---

## 1. What the system is
A complete RP9 package of:
- 10 modules (01–10)
- 16 image series (Module 11)
- Appendix (ASCII & Mermaid)
- System files (Index + Recursion)

---

## 2. Core principle
**Everything is based on Vesica.**
Relation → Triad → Hexagon → Spiral → Dimension.

---

## 3. Structure (short)
- Modules 01–10 = theory
- Module 11 = images
- Appendix = technical structures
- Index files = navigation

---

## 4. Recursive reading
Module 01 → 10
→ Image 01 → 16
→ Appendix

---

## 5. RP9 Formula (short)
$$
\text{RP9} = \Delta + \pi + \varphi + \psi
$$

Everything is the same function in different scales.
