# **Meta-Corollary M0 — On Relational Legitimacy and Structural Misplacement**

## **Status**

**Non-ground meta-corollary.**  
This document is **not part of the foundation** and introduces **no new causal structure**.

It exists solely as a **structural clarification** derived from **Axiom R0 — Relational Necessity**.

---

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this meta-corollary is to make explicit a distinction that is otherwise often left implicit:

> **The distinction between internal coherence and axiomatic legitimacy.**

This document does **not** evaluate correctness, truth, solvability, or usefulness.  
It only addresses **structural status**.

---

## **Core Observation**

It is possible for a system to be:

- internally consistent
    
- formally complete
    
- operationally functional
    

**without** being axiomaticaly grounded in its own foundation.

Such systems can:

- generate valid results internally
    
- preserve coherence indefinitely
    
- yet lack derivational legitimacy with respect to their originating condition.
    

This is not an error.  
It is a **structural consequence**.

---

## **Relation to Axiom R0**

Axiom R0 states:

> All functioning requires differentiation.  
> Differentiation is only possible as relation.  
> Relation requires at least two distinct poles.

From this follows:

- Any system that does not derive its primitives relationally  
    operates **outside** the axiomatic source.
    
- Such systems may remain coherent,  
    but they are **structurally secondary**.
    

This document introduces **no additional assumptions** beyond this relation.

---

## **Structural Misplacement**

A structural misplacement occurs when:

- a secondary structure
    
- is treated as if it were foundational
    
- or as if it could validate its own ground.
    

In such cases:

- the system cannot resolve questions about its own limits
    
- attempts at resolution remain internal
    
- escalation increases complexity, not legitimacy
    

This is a **classification result**, not a critique.

---

## **One-Way Derivability**

Axiom R0 implies **asymmetric derivability**:

- the foundational condition can explain secondary structures
    
- secondary structures cannot explain the foundation
    

This asymmetry is **not negotiable** and does not depend on interpretation.

It is the same asymmetry later locked as **Position X**, but here shown at the level of system classification.

---

## **Negative Capability**

This meta-corollary defines what RP9 **does not do**:

- RP9 does not solve secondary problems on their own terms
    
- RP9 does not enter internal debates of derived systems
    
- RP9 does not provide alternative constructions
    

RP9 only classifies **why** such problems arise  
and **why** certain resolutions are structurally unavailable.

---

## **Scope Clarification**

This document:

- does not privilege any domain
    
- does not target any specific theory
    
- does not depend on particular examples
    

Any sufficiently complex, self-contained formal system  
can instantiate the structure described here.

---

## **Final Statement**

> A system may be correct within itself and still be ungrounded with respect to its origin.
> 
> RP9 does not invalidate such systems.  
> It explains their position.
