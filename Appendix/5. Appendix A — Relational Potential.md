# **Appendix A — Relational Potential**

<br />

### _Interpretation and definitional support (non-ground)_

**Status:**  
This appendix is a **definitional and interpretative support**.  
It adds **no causal force**, **no new structure**, and **no additional ground**.  
It is **completely dependent on Axiom R0**.

---

## **A.0 — README (Short)**

This appendix clarifies the concept of **potential** within RP9 without introducing any new ground or causality.

- **Axiom R0** states the condition for potential to exist.

- **LEVEL 1** refers to **singular relational potential**: possibility without function or process.

- **LEVEL 2** refers to **plural functional potentials**: actualized and combined possibilities.

The appendix describes the necessary cycle:

**potential → actualization → stabilization → new potential**

as a consequence of relational differentiation.

---

## **A.1 — Definition: Differentiation**

**Differentiation** denotes relational distinction.

Without differentiation:

- no relation  
- no potential  
- no function  

Differentiation is therefore a **necessary condition**, not a process.

---

## **A.2 — Corollary R0-P**

### _Relational potential and its actualization_

**Given Axiom R0**, it follows:

> **Every functioning relation contains an inherent potential that is not yet actualized.**

This potential consists of:

- differentiation without process  
- asymmetry without movement  
- tension without manifestation  

The potential is **relational**, not substantial.

---

### **Actualization**

> **Actualization occurs when relational potential turns into function.**

This implies:

- tension is reduced through process  
- differentiation assumes the form of movement  
- potential ceases to be potential at the very moment it is manifested  

Actualization is **not an addition**, but a **negation of potential as potential**.

---

### **Phase Relation**

Potential and actualization are:

- not opposites  
- not separate entities  
- not simultaneous within the same relational phase  

They are **two phases of the same relation**, ordered by structure or time.

---

### **Consequence**

> **All manifestation is local and temporary.  
> All potential is structural and prior.**

No actualization can exhaust all potential, since total dissolution of differentiation would result in functional collapse.

---

## **A.3 — Diagram Sheet: Relational Cycle**

```

Relational potential  
↓  
Actualization  
↓  
Stabilization  
↓  
New relational potential

```

**Phases (strict):**

- **Relational potential:** differentiation without process  
- **Actualization:** relation in motion  
- **Stabilization:** local and temporal order  
- **New potential:** residual asymmetry and renewed differentiation  

The cycle is **necessary**, **non-teleological**, and **non-final**.

---

## **A.4 — Terminological Lock**

For this appendix:

- _Potential_ = relational tension prior to function  
- _Actualization_ = function that reduces tension  
- _Manifestation_ = observable phase of actualization  

The term **“functional”** is reserved exclusively for **LEVEL 2**.

---

## **Final Lock**

> **Relation creates possibility.  
> Potential precedes function.  
> Function arises only secondarily.**
