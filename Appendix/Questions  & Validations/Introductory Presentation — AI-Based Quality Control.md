# **Introductory Presentation — AI-Based Quality Control**

<br />

### **Purpose and Method**

This quality control is carried out using an advanced language model-based AI system (Google LLM Notebook), not with the aim of replacing human review, but to **test in isolation the structural function of question formulations and the formal consistency of the answers**.

The central object of the review is **not the AI ​​itself**, but **the questions**.
The AI ​​system is used here as a **methodological instrument** to determine whether the questions, as formulated, necessarily lead to traceable, consistent and regular answers – or whether they allow for interpretive slippage, bias or semantic evasions.

---

### **Why AI is used in this quality function**

A sufficiently advanced AI system has a specific and limited advantage in this context:

- It has **no self-interest** in the outcome

- It lacks **personal investment** in theories, traditions or positions

- It is not bound to human disciplinary areas or established interpretive patterns

This does not mean that AI “knows more” than a human.
This means that AI **does not automatically fall back on pre-programmed human interpretive habits**, especially when faced with abstract, meta-structural or pre-axiomatic questions.

In practice, AI functions here as a **bias-reducing medium**.

---

### **Limitations and control mechanism**

At the same time, AI use introduces another known problem:
AI tends to fill in gaps, generalize or assume plausibility if the questions are unclearly formulated.

For this reason, **question formulation is strictly locked**:

- All questions are restricted to internal, formal analysis

- External criteria are explicitly prohibited

- Each question is designed to force binary or localizable answers

It is therefore **the precision of the questions**, not the intelligence of the AI, that determines the quality of the outcome.

---

### **Relationship to human review**

This AI-based quality control is **not a replacement for human review**, but a complement that operates at a level where human cognition often encounters difficulties.

As the originator of the question, with many years of experience in testing these formulations in human dialogue, it is well documented how easily even qualified reviewers:

- project their own frameworks onto the questions

- answer _what they think the question is about_, rather than what is actually asked

- mix in interpretation, evaluation or external context despite instructions

This quality function aims to **eliminate precisely these effects**, not through authority, but through strict method.

---

### **Openness and verifiability**

The entire material – including:

- question formulations

- instructions

- AI-generated answers

is published openly and unchanged, so that each external reviewer can:

- assess the quality of the questions

- verify that the answers follow from the questions

- identify any flaws in the construction

The quality control makes no claims to truth or finality.
It makes only one claim:

> **If the questions are correctly formulated, the answers necessarily follow.**

---

### **Summary position**

This AI-based stress testing is therefore not an argument _for_ the content, but a test _of_ the function of the questions.

The result is not proof.
It is a **methodological trail**.
