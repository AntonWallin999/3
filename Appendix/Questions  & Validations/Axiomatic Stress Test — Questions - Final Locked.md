# **RP9 — Axiomatic Stress Test (Final Locked Prompt)**

> **Authority & Scope Lock**  
> You must answer **strictly within the presented repository material**.  
> The review concerns **structural conditions only**, not truth, usefulness, elegance, persuasion, or comparison with external frameworks.  
> You may not introduce additional axioms, empirical criteria, alternative models, or domain assumptions.  
> If something is not explicitly supportable from the material, state: **“Not determined from presented material.”**

---

## **Step 1 — Methodological Capacity (Isolated)**

**Q1.** _Can the applied review method, in principle, identify a condition that precedes axioms **within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact**?_

**Instruction:**  
This question concerns the **capacity and limits of the review method itself**, not the content under review.

**Required output:**  
Answer **Yes / No**, then give **one short reason** grounded in the repository’s own review instructions.

---

## **Step 2 — Implicit Assumption Test (Internal Only)**

**Q2.** _Can any implicit assumption be identified **without violating the system’s own definitional rules**?_

**Instruction:**  
An assumption counts only if it can be shown **explicitly and internally** from the repository text, **without importing external criteria**.

**Required output:**  
Either:

- **“Yes — implicit assumption identified:”** and then **cite the exact element** (document + exact quoted line(s) or uniquely identifiable passage), plus **one sentence** explaining why it is implicit;  
    or
    
- **“No — no implicit assumption identified under internal rules.”**
    

---

## **Step 3 — Structural Integrity Test (Locked Definitions)**

**Q3.** _Is the relational condition (Axiom R0) **explicit**, **minimal**, and **causally isolated** within the repository?_

**Locked definitions:**

- **Explicit** = stated directly as the foundational condition, not reconstructed or inferred.
    
- **Minimal** = removal of any element **alters the condition** and cannot be restored **without introducing an alternative formulation**.
    
- **Causally isolated** = no backward dependence of the foundation on derived structures, classifications, applications, or appendices.
    

**Required output:**  
Provide three separate determinations: **Explicit: Yes/No**, **Minimal: Yes/No**, **Causally isolated: Yes/No**, each with **one citation** to the repository text.

---

## **Step 4 — Axiom R0 Non-Contradiction Audit (Binary Verdict)**

**Q4.** _Using **Axiom R0 as the sole evaluative standard**, determine whether any document, statement, definition, classification, or instruction in the repository **contradicts, violates, bypasses, or implicitly negates** Axiom R0._

**A contradiction includes (exhaustive criteria):**

1. Introducing a **non-relational primitive** at foundation-level status
    
2. Introducing **function without relation**
    
3. Introducing **necessity not grounded in Axiom R0**
    
4. Introducing an **alternative foundational condition** (explicit or implicit)
    

**Required output (locked):**  
Either:

- **“Violation identified:”** followed by **(a)** exact document reference and **(b)** the violating passage (quote or uniquely identifiable excerpt) and **(c)** which of the four criteria it violates;  
    or
    
- **“No internal contradiction with Axiom R0 identified.”**
    

---

## **Output constraints (mandatory)**

- Use only information present in the repository.
    
- No speculation. No “likely” / “seems”.
    
- Every “Yes” must include at least one **exact citation** to the repository.
    
- If no citation is possible, answer **“Not determined from presented material.”**
