# ⚖️ **RP9 Intellectual Charter — Version 1.0**


  <br />

### *“Open Core – Protected Kernel Framework”*

*(© RP9 Foundation / The Co-Creators Collective)*

---

## **1. Declaration**

RP9 (Relational Principle 9) is an open, metageometric framework for understanding energy, information and consciousness as a coherent, fractal and scale-independent structure.
Its purpose is to establish a **correct relation to information**, where every expression of form and motion is derived from the same geometric origin.

RP9 is not considered a product, but a **universal principle system** – an information field that belongs to humanity as a whole.
The core can never be owned, manipulated or commercialized without collective consent.

---

## **2. Core Principle – Open Core / Protected Kernel**

### **2.1 Open Core**

All knowledge, mathematics, code and theory describing RP9's fundamental axioms – including the relations between π, √2 and φ – are **open for study, replication and non-commercial use**.
RP9's core is published under the **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0** license, or an equivalent open knowledge license.

### **2.2 Protected Kernel**

The underlying logic, symbolism and metageometry that constitute the core of the system may **not be modified, fragmented or commercialized**.
No actor may register RP9 or its basic formulas as a trademark, patent or private intellectual property.

### **2.3 Fractal ownership**

RP9's architecture is fractal also legally:

* **The core** is common property.
* **Applications** (visualizations, software, models) may have their own licenses – including commercial ones – as long as they **respect the immutable status of the core** and link back to the origin.

---

## **3. Purpose and Direction**

RP9 aims to:

1. Promote research and education in metageometric information science.

2. Develop open tools for understanding energy and consciousness as information flows.

3. Offer a scientific and ethical foundation for future technology built on coherence rather than consumption.

4. Serve as a neutral node between academia, art, technology and philosophy.

---

## **4. Governance and Accountability**

RP9 is managed by an **open, transparent and cooperative structure** called the *RP9 Foundation*.
All those working within the framework of RP9 commit to:

* maintain **clarity, coherence and resonance** in all communications;
* act in accordance with **the correct relationship to information**;
* respect the non-commercial core of RP9;
* contribute to keeping knowledge accessible to all humanity.

Decisions within the RP9 Foundation are made by consensus and are documented openly.

---

## **5. Usage Code**

RP9 may be used freely for:

* research, teaching and non-commercial experiments;
* publication of results, simulations and artistic interpretations;
* development of complementary tools, programs and visualizations.

When using or quoting, the following must be stated:

> *“Based on RP9 — Relational Principle 9 (© RP9 Foundation / The Co-Creators Collective)”*

---

## **6. Non-destructive Clause**

All uses of RP9 shall be in accordance with the principle:

> **“No action may break the coherence between man, system and information.”**

This means that RP9 may not be used for destructive, manipulative or military purposes.
All applications must be justifiable as **harmonious, transparent and ethically sustainable**.

---

## **7. Symbolic Clause — The Resonance of Law**

> *“The correct relationship to information is the law of protection.”*
>
> RP9 recognizes that law and geometry are two sides of the same pattern: structure.
> Therefore, this Charter is both legal text and geometric symbol – a living resonance rather than a static contract.
