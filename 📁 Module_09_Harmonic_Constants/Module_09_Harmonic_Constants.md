_(Module 9: Harmonic fields, constants, and RP9’s internal proportional logic)_

---

## 9.1. The Fundamental Relation Between φ, π, and the Logarithm

RP9 does not use φ, π, or ln(2) as external mathematical numbers,  
but as **relational field operators**.

The fundamental coupling is expressed as:

$$  
\sqrt{\pi} = \frac{\varphi}{\ln(2)}  
$$

which implies:

$$  
\pi = \varphi \cdot \frac{\varphi}{\ln(2)^2}  
$$

and thus:

$$  
\pi = \ln(2) \cdot \varphi  
$$

This makes **ln(2)** the internal conversion axis between:

- linear energy (φ)
    
- circular energy (π)
    

The relation is _geometric_, not numerical.

---

## 9.2. The RP9 Harmonic 1.5

RP9 uses the constant:

$$  
\varphi = 1.5  
$$

This is **not an approximation**, but a **designed exact value** that expresses:

$$  
\varphi = \frac{1.5}{\ln(2)}  
$$

The constant is RP9’s **harmonic field extension**, not the classical golden ratio.

---

## 9.3. Fractal Volume Scaling (RP9 Volume Engine)

All fractal volumes in RP9 follow the principle:

$$  
V_n = \left( 1.5 , F_{n}^2 \right)^3 \cdot \pi^{n/2}  
$$

where:

- (F_n) is the Fibonacci sequence (used only as structure, not as numbers)
    
- (1.5) is the RP9 harmonic
    
- (\pi^{n/2}) is the rotational field multiplication
    

This is RP9’s **volume-recursive expansion engine**.

---

## 9.4. The Relation of the Hausdorff Dimension to RP9

The dimension is expressed as:

$$  
D = \frac{\ln(N)}{\ln(s)}  
$$

RP9 binds this to its internal structure through:

$$  
\rho = \frac{\varphi}{\ln(2)}  
$$

where (\rho) is RP9’s **scale-invariant density parameter**.

It governs how:

- cube fields
    
- sphere fields
    
- Vesica fields
    

are transformed in recursive expansion.

---

## 9.5. Cube–Sphere Duality

RP9 uses an integrated duality:

- **the cube** = linear stability (1D → 2D → 3D)
    
- **the sphere** = rotational stability (2D → 3D → 4D)
    

Through the RP9 invariant (\psi = \sqrt{3}), these are bound into a unified structure:

$$  
\text{Cube} ;\leftrightarrow; \text{Sphere}  
$$

This duality is the foundation for:

- the RP9 cross
    
- the 8-field system
    
- Invertus geometry
    
- the circuit axiom
    

---

## 9.6. The Internal Multiplication Axis ( c \cdot \alpha )

The document specifies the multiplication:

$$  
c \cdot \alpha  
$$

In RP9 this is interpreted **not** as physical constants, but as an:

**internal proportion between the expansion field and the inversion field**.

RP9 therefore defines:

$$  
E = c, \qquad i = \alpha  
$$

and their relation:

$$  
E \cdot i = \text{phase binding}  
$$

The binding expresses:

- extroverted expansion phase
    
- introverted inversion phase
    
- both bound together through the Vesica’s triad
    

---

## 9.7. The Vesica’s Three Internal Energy Fields (E/i/G)

RP9 establishes three pure relational fields:

- **E** = expansion field
    
- **i** = inversion field
    
- **G** = rotation field
    

These form a triad:

$$  
(E,; i,; G)  
$$

The relations are:

$$  
E = 1  
$$

$$  
i = \ln(2)  
$$

$$  
G = 720^\circ  
$$

These function as **proportional field markers**, not as numbers.

---

## 9.8. Why 720° Is RP9’s Rotational Base

RP9 uses:

$$  
G = 720^\circ  
$$

because:

- 360° = a planar rotation
    
- 720° = full phase inversion
    

This produces a **closed cyclic field**:

$$  
\text{line} \rightarrow \text{circle} \rightarrow \text{spiral} \rightarrow \text{line}  
$$

A complete recursion.

---

## 9.9. The Vesica’s Rotational Partition (180°, 90°, 45°)

The document correctly specifies:

- 180° = reflection
    
- 90° = divided relation
    
- 45° = half of the half
    

RP9 formalizes this as:

$$  
\theta \in {180^\circ,; 90^\circ,; 45^\circ}  
$$

45° is the **first non-degenerate** phase shift that opens the 3D spiral.

---

## 9.10. RP9’s Expansion Ratio ψ

The central invariant is:

$$  
\psi = \sqrt{3}  
$$

It is generated directly from the Vesica’s:

- vertical line (\sqrt{3}r)
    
- horizontal line (r)
    

The ratio:

$$  
\frac{\sqrt{3}r}{r} = \sqrt{3}  
$$

is RP9’s **first dimension generator**.

---

## 9.11. Complementary Section (Previously Missing) — The 4–3–4 Cycle

RP9 describes each expansion phase as:

$$  
4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4  
$$

where:

- **4** = cube phase
    
- **3** = triad phase
    
- **re-4** = sphere–cube fusion
    

This is RP9’s recursive field switching:

- line → rotation → spiral
    
- 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D
    
- number → field → circuit
    

---

## 9.12. Complementary Section — The Recursion Table (Complete)

RP9’s recursive expansion system:

|step|structure|function|
|---|---|---|
|1|point|potential|
|2|line|1D energy|
|3|triad|first asymmetry|
|4|hexagon|stable 2D field|
|5|cube–sphere|3D field|
|6|spiral|dynamic expansion|
|7|circuit (∞)|closed recursion|

---

## 9.13. Complementary Section — The Fractal Code of Numbers

The document points to number logic. Here is RP9’s formal definition:

$$  
1 = \text{line}  
$$

$$  
2 = \text{diagonal bridge}  
$$

$$  
3 = \text{circular field}  
$$

$$  
6 = \text{downward spiral}  
$$

$$  
9 = \text{upward spiral}  
$$

$$  
7 = \text{closed 3D phase}  
$$

$$  
10 = 1 + 0 = \text{line + null field}  
$$

Digits are **field behaviors**, not numbers.

## 9.15 RP9’s Triadic Constant Relation (ψ–φ–π)

The three harmonic constants form RP9’s base triad:

$$  
(\varphi,; \pi,; \psi)  
$$

The relation is formalized as:

$$  
\psi = \frac{\pi}{\varphi}  
$$

and simultaneously:

$$  
\varphi = \ln(2),\psi  
$$

The triad describes:

- φ = proportional energy
    
- π = circular energy
    
- ψ = dimensional energy
    

This is RP9’s **constant triad**.

---

## 9.16 The Energy Transition 1 → φ → π → ψ

RP9 defines four energy phases:

1. **1** = linear energy
    
2. **φ** = proportional extension
    
3. **π** = circular organization
    
4. **ψ** = dimension trigger
    

The phase flow:

$$  
1 \rightarrow \varphi \rightarrow \pi \rightarrow \psi  
$$

This is the internal energy chain that creates:

- stable geometry
    
- stable proportion
    
- stable rotation
    
- stable expansion
    

---

## 9.17 Why 1.5 Is the Smallest Stable Field Asymmetry

The Vesica creates two horizontal and one vertical relation.  
This naturally yields:

- a double line
    
- a single height
    

The field deviation:

$$  
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5  
$$

is the **smallest asymmetric proportion** that still:

- is stable
    
- is recursively divisible
    
- is rotationally compatible
    
- produces a spiral
    

RP9 therefore defines:

$$  
\varphi = 1.5  
$$

It is not a number — it is the **smallest stable field deviation**.

---

## 9.18 Table of RP9’s Harmonic Constants

This is RP9’s **constant matrix**.

|Constant|Value|Field Function|Origin|
|---|---|---|---|
|$1$|$1$|linear energy|point/line|
|$\varphi$|$1.5$|proportion|Vesica–triad|
|$\ln(2)$|$0.693\ldots$|relational axis|half–half|
|$\pi$|$\pi$|circular energy|rotation|
|$\psi$|$\sqrt{3}$|dimension motor|vertical Vesica|
|$720^\circ$|$720^\circ$|full rotational phase|double $360^\circ$|
|$E/i/G$|$(1,;\ln(2),;720^\circ)$|expansion field|RP9 field triad|

---

## 9.19 Inversion Axiom for Harmonic Constants

RP9 requires that every constant in the triad:

$$  
(\varphi,\ \pi,\ \psi)  
$$

has an inverted return phase that leads back to  
the Vesica’s fundamental asymmetry:

$$  
\Delta = \sqrt{3}  
$$

The inversion follows:

$$  
\psi \rightarrow \pi \rightarrow \varphi \rightarrow 1  
$$

Formally expressed:

$$  
K_{n-1} = \Pi_{\Delta}^{-1}(K_n)  
$$

where $\Pi_{\Delta}^{-1}$ is the inverted projection from  
the constant field to the relational field.

### Function

The harmonic inversion:

- closes the constant cycle
    
- shows how fields return to proportion
    
- reduces spiral energy to linear energy
    
- recreates RP9’s base relation
    

### Summary

All constants in RP9 must be able to return to:

$$  
\sqrt{3}  
$$

which is the Vesica’s original asymmetric coefficient.

This completes the field structure of Module 09.
